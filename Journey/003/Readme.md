# Create Wordpress site in Docker

## Introduction

I decided to do this project as the first step in testing out setting up a static wordpress site in AWS S3.  Also a reason to get some hands on with Docker

## Use Case

- The use case for this is setting up a fully functional WordPress site in Docker.  

## Cloud Research

- The biggest part of the this project was creating the docker-compose file.  The file is written in YAMAL which is extremely strict on spacing.  Figuring out its spacing requirments seems to be a right of passage working with YAMAL.
