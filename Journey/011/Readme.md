# Adding CA with LetsEncrypt to Apache site

## Introduction

Add and configure LetsEncrypt and certbot for using TLS on Apache site

## Use Case

- I chose LetsEncrypt as it is a free Certificate Authority to enable TLS on a single web server.

## Cloud Research

- I used an AWS Compute blog post to install and configure certbot and letsencrypt. The install was successful \ no errors but the HTTPS is not working.  I will need to do further testing on this to get it working.
