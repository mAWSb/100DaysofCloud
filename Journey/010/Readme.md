# Added Self Signed Certificate to Apache website

## Introduction

I chose to test out adding a self signed cert, because I wanted to get familiar with the how certs work on linux \ apache installs.   

## Use Case

- A common use case for a self signed cert is a internal site that is used for testing.  For a external (interent site) it is best practice to use a CA cert, by a truster provider Comodo etc.

## Cloud Research

- I primarily used AWS doucmentation for adding this to my site.  However, my research took me on a journey to a few other SSL \ TLS related sites.  All listed below.
