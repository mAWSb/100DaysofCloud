# Enabling MFA \ Changing device on AWS accounts

## Cloud Research

- Being that it is Sunday, I decided to go a little easier than normal with my project today.  Although that doesn't make it any less important, this may be more important that any of the projects I end up doing for this challenge.  Enabling MFA on your Root account(s) is an absolute critical step that must be set on all of your AWS accounts or any cloud account.

- What sparked this topic was that I just got a new mobile phone and need to switch over all of my 2FA accounts including my AWS accounts.  Its a simple task to do but again is probably the most cricital of anything you will do in the cloud.  Below is a link to AWS docs on how to setup MFA on your device.  Any user with high level privileges should have MFA enabled.
