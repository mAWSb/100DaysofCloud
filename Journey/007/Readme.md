# Read first half of AWS Security Best Practices Whitepaper | Installed posh-git 

## Cloud Research

- Decidced to ingest some knowledge and read the AWS Security Best Practices Whitepaper.  Very interesting info on how to properly setup access to AWS resources, services, and data.  Looking forward to finishing up the second half of this document tomorrow.

- Also added the posh-git module to my local powershell to make pushing these updates to github a little more easier via Powershell.  So far it's very nice.
