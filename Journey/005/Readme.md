# Codecademy - Learn Python 3 \ Syntax lesson

## Cloud Research

- While not directly a cloud technology, Python is a key skill required to be successful working in cloud.  This might be sliding into #100daysofcode territory but I feel I need to beef up my skills with this language so I decided to dive in.  The first lesson was just the basic, but Codecademy does a great job have hands on examples for every part of the lesson.  This will probably be my "side-learn" for now as I want to continue on cloud tech for the majority of #100daysofcloud.
